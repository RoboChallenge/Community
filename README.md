# Community

[中文](./README_zh-CN.md) | **English**

We aim to build a unified, open, and large-scale real-robot-based benchmark platform for embodied intelligence.

**Released: RoboChallenge Annual Report (2025 Q4 – 2026 Q1)**

Based on tens of thousands of real-robot evaluation runs, this report analyzes the Table30 leaderboard performance and reviews representative task cases. It brings together practical insights from participating model teams and volunteers, and compiles recommendations from the RoboChallenge committee and the broader community to inform the platform’s future development.

## How to Join the RC Working Group

Follow these three simple steps to join the RoboChallenge working group and contribute to the future of embodied intelligence.

### Step 1: Read the Governance Model

The **RoboChallenge Committee** is established to ensure that the initiative operates with transparency, fairness, and long-term sustainability, guided by the principles of openness, collaboration, and consensus.

> The organizational structure consists of two key components: the **Steering Committee** and a set of **Working Groups**.

**Read more about our principle and governance model from [here](https://robochallenge.ai/RoboChallenge_Committee_Governance_Model.pdf).**

### Step 2: Find the Working Group

Working Groups (WGs) are the primary execution units of RoboChallenge. Each WG consists of a team of Contributors responsible for a specific aspect of RoboChallenge activities. Each WG has a secretary who is responsible for organizing meetings and supporting the group’s operations.


**Current Working Groups include**:

* **🛠️ Benchmark & Task Design WG**: Responsible for designing and preparing new benchmarks, tasks, and datasets.
* **🤖 Lab Maintenance WG**: Responsible for accepting machine donations, hosting the machines, and conducting the tests.
* **💻 Platform Development WG**: Responsible for developing and maintaining the `robochallenge.ai` website, API services, and data distribution.
* **📢 Community Engagement WG**: Responsible for building awareness through hackathons, academic collaborations, online/offline events and social media.

*Note: Each Working Group (WG) may propose new initiatives, submit proposals for approval, and publish public reports on their progress and outcomes.*

A Working Group is composed of members from partner organizations from the community.
